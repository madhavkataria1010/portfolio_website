## Introduction to the App Router

The Next.js App Router, introduced in version 13, represents a significant shift in how we build Next.js applications. It moves away from the `pages` directory paradigm to a new `app` directory, leveraging React Server Components by default.

### Key Features

*   **Server Components:** Reduce client-side JavaScript and improve initial load times.
*   **Nested Layouts:** Easily create complex UI structures with shared layouts.
*   **Route Groups:** Organize routes without affecting the URL path.
*   **Loading UI:** Built-in support for loading states with `loading.js`.
*   **Error Handling:** Graceful error management with `error.js`.

### Benefits

1.  **Improved Performance:** Server Components and granular control over client-side JavaScript lead to faster applications.
2.  **Better Developer Experience:** More intuitive routing and data fetching patterns.
3.  **Enhanced Code Organization:** Clearer project structure with the `app` directory.

```javascript
// Example of a Server Component in app/page.tsx
async function getData() {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/...')
  if (!res.ok) {
    throw new Error('Failed to fetch data')
  }
  return res.json()
}
 
export default async function Page() {
  const data = await getData()
 
  return <main>{/* ... */}</main>
}
```

The App Router is a powerful addition to Next.js, enabling developers to build more performant and maintainable web applications.
